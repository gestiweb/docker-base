docker-base
======================

Base repository for almost every docker public image at user @gestiweb.
We do not depend on third parties. Everything here is referred to our own repos.

It has 3 folders, and each folder is a section:

* base: Base raw images. Generally created using debian's instructions.
* auto: Autogenerated images for docker hub.
* dev: Real branch for final products.

Base -> gestiweb/base:*
---------------------------
These images are raw plain containers.

* debian-jessie: raw image for debian 8.0

Auto -> gestiweb/auto:*-$(YMD)
---------------------------
These images are autogenerated from docker hub.
They mainly serve to add lots of packages, so they get uploaded quickly.
They aren't updated so much, so newer versions of the OS will be served through
"dev" images.

* debian-jessie: lots of commonly used packages to get a only one big image for
    anything. Also it is dist-upgraded.
* apache-server: derivated from the prior image "gestiweb/auto:debian-jessie",
    we add lots of packages useful for apache.
* mariadb-server: derivated from "gestiweb/auto:debian-jessie" we added packages
    to get mariadb and other useful packages.

Dev -> gestiweb/*:base-$(YMD)
----------------------------
Using the autogenerated version, with a simple dist-upgrade, these images
make a layer for easy upgrades, so a new upgrade doesn't download every package
again.


Dev -> gestiweb/\*:latest  gestiweb/\*:$(YMD)
----------------------------
These images are meant to be built on any computer, and pushed using a regular
ADSL. It should not take much time.
