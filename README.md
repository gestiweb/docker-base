docker-base
======================

Base repository for almost every docker public image at user @gestiweb.
We do not depend on third parties. Everything here is referred to our own repos.

It has 3 folders, and each folder is a section:

* base: Base raw images. Generally created using debian's instructions.
* auto: Autogenerated images for docker hub.
* dev: Real branch for final products.

Base -> gestiweb/base:*
---------------------------
These images are raw plain containers.

* debian-jessie: raw image for debian 8.0

Auto -> gestiweb/auto:*-$(YMD)
---------------------------
These images are autogenerated from docker hub.
They mainly serve to add lots of packages, so they get uploaded quickly.
They aren't updated so much, so newer versions of the OS will be served through
"dev" images.

* debian-jessie: lots of commonly used packages to get a only one big image for
    anything. Also it is dist-upgraded.
* apache-server: derivated from the prior image "gestiweb/auto:debian-jessie",
    we add lots of packages useful for apache.
* mariadb-server: derivated from "gestiweb/auto:debian-jessie" we added packages
    to get mariadb and other useful packages.

Upgrade -> gestiweb/*:upgrade-$(YMD)
----------------------------
Using the autogenerated version, with a simple dist-upgrade, these images
make a layer for easy upgrades, so a new upgrade doesn't download every package
again.


Dev -> gestiweb/\*:latest  gestiweb/\*:$(YMD)
----------------------------
These images are meant to be built on any computer, and pushed using a regular
ADSL. It should not take much time.


Example route of compiling
-----------------------------------------

*debian-jessie*

0. gestiweb/base:debian-jessie (raw image)
0. gestiweb/auto:debian-jessie-20160408c (package bundle at hub)
0. gestiweb/debian-jessie:upgrade-20160408 | :upgrade (upgrade layer)
0. gestiweb/debian-jessie:20160408 | :latest (release layer)

*apache-server*
0. gestiweb/debian-jessie:upgrade-20160408 | :upgrade (from debian-jessie)
0. gestiweb/auto:apache-server-20160408 (package bundle at hub)
0. gestiweb/apache-server:upgrade-20160408 | :upgrade (upgrade layer)
0. gestiweb/apache-server:20160408 | :latest (release layer)


*TL-DR;*
```
(raw-jessie) RAW -> BUNDLE -> UPGRADE -> RELEASE (debian-jessie)
                                |
      /-------------------------/
      |
      |\
      | \
      |  (*) -> BUNDLE -> UPGRADE -> RELEASE (apache-server)
      |
      |\
      | \
      |  (*) -> BUNDLE -> UPGRADE -> RELEASE (mariadb-server)
      |
    (...)

```

Raw image
----------------------
Outdated on purpose. Built once for a stable release.
Once for jessie, once for stretch.
Surely it contains outdated vulnerable software.

Built using debian recommendations.
One can safely depend upon this image and never will be needed a re-download.


Package Bundle at Hub
--------------------------
From a prior image (raw layer or upgrade layer), bundle everything we could need
later in a big image. This work is done by the docker hub.
The software on these images may not be up to date. These images may be static
one year or two.

Upgrade Layer
--------------------------
Thin layer to serve updates. This may be updated once a month.

Why I'm using the Upgrade Layer as the base of new images, instead of using
the Package Bundle?
The reason is, if I do not use the upgrade layer from debian, that updates
would be distributed again and again in any child upgrade layer.

So, to avoid re-downloading the same upgrades for every flavour I have, any
child upgrade layer MUST depend on a upgrade layer of the parent.


Release Layer
--------------------------
These layers include final usable software, with any final modifications needed.
